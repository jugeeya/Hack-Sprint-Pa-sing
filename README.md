# Hack-Sprint-Passing

## Summary ##
**Project Name:** "Passing"

**Team Name:** "Hungry Wolves"

**Language:** Swift

**Platform:** iOS

**Summary:** An iOS app posing as a terminal app that actually functions as a secure password storage application accessed by singing a specific melody into the microphone.


## Details ##
This is our project for *UCLA ACM HackSprint*. In four weeks, we will create a unique "password manager" application for iOS using Swift.

Upon opening the application, the user is presented with a terminal window in order to deter curious eyes. To gain access to the applications within the app, the user must sing a few notes into the microphone. If the melody is correct, the terminal window will change to a view with a table of accounts and a "plus" button at the top to add new accounts to the table. Clicking on a cell in the table brings the user to a details page that lists:
1) Account type + associated image
2) Username
3) Password
4) Comments the user listed when adding the account
5) A button to open the URL associated with the account
